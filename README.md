## What the app is about

It's a modern-ish messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.

The app is a bit different than the one in the tutorial.

Differences:
- animations
- added timestamps to message bubbles
- the messages are actually sorted
- using a listview builder for better performance
- better security checking and handling forms
